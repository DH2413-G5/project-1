          <p>Submergency is a  virtual reality experience that takes us on a journey through our oceans - 
            from what it was like generations ago to what it is like now. It is an effort to bring the 
            plight of the oceans closer to us.</p>
            
          <p>After a brief tutorial to familiarize themselves with the controls, our viewer finds themselves 
          in the wide blue ocean. In front of them is a timeline. As they swim along the timeline into the future, 
          they can see how the ocean changes along with the decades, with plants gradually looking sicker, fewer fish, 
          and drastically but steadily increasing plastic waste. The viewer can also swim to the surface of the ocean.</p>

          <p>Now, the viewer is no longer sitting in the comfort of their home reading about plastic in the ocean and 
          suffering animal life; they can experience it themselves almost first-hand.</p>

        <div class="main" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
          <p>The issue of pollution in our oceans, especially with plastic, has been getting worse over the years.
          Since 1990 until 2019, the amount of plastic in our oceans has roughly doubled every decade. 
          This has resulted in the loss of a great deal of wild-life and the endangerment of the entire ocean ecosystem, from plants and fish to corals.</p>

          <p>Most of us will never get to see the reality of our oceans in person. Which is why we created Submergency - 
          to provide a safe but honest way to see and experience the true state of our oceans and how they have changed over the years.</p>

          <p>There are two ways of interacting with our virtual environment:</p>
          <h3>Quest 2 + Hand-held Controllers</h3>
          <p>The participant puts on the Quest 2 headset and stands within a demarcated space on the ground. They use two hand-help Quest 2 
            controllers in order to move. The controllers are moved in a natural swimming motion. The participant must hold down a button at 
            the start of a movement and release the button at its end. There is another button for grasping objects. The direction of the 
            swimming motion determines the direction in which the participant will be propelled.</p>
          <h3>Quest 2 + Hand Tracking</h3>
          <p>The participant puts on the Quest 2 headset and stands within a demarcated space on the ground.  They must move their hands in 
            the natural swimming motion while keeping their fingers together as one would while swimming.  The direction of the swimming motion 
            determines the direction in which the participant will be propelled.</p>

          <p>Submergency is built for a large variety of people, there is something for everyone. Experiencing the reality of our oceans 
            through a novel swimming experience is exciting for adults and children alike. The ocean is filled with things like plants, 
            beautiful fish, and unfortunately plastics. This project hopes to raise awareness about the problem of plastic pollution for 
            adults and children alike.</p>

                  <h3>The environment</h3>
                  <p>Most of the rocks are free downloaded 3D models but with different applied textures and normal maps. 
                  LODs are also added to all rocks. They are all saved as prefabs and placed out in different locations in the environment.</p>

                  <p>To create the sand and mountains, terrain tools have been used and colored with different diffuse textures and normal maps. 
                  The terrain has also been painted to be lowered and raised in different spots to bring the terrain more to life. 
                  The development process for the sand and mountains were harder than expected as everything in the terrain is connected. 
                  Therefore, if you made one little change to one small part of the terrain, everything had to be changed. 
                  It was also not decided on exactly how we wanted the terrain so there were lots of tries and failures.</p>

                  <p>We started out by looking for free 3D Unity assets to add plastic trash to our environment, but this proved somewhat hard to come by. 
                  Therefore some of the objects had to be modeled in Blender, and then imported into Unity. One challenge with this part of the 
                  environment was that the amount of objects needed to convey the reality of how plastic pollution of the oceans has increased 
                  over the decades posed serious processing issues. To solve this, LODs had to be applied, and some parts of the environment where 
                  the user cannot go was decorated with static meshes, instead of interactable objects. </p>

                  <h3>Water and post-processing</h3>
                  <p>To create the underwater environment, several methods were used. 
                    Different post-processing effects were implemented: <b>Split toning</b> with brown shadows and blue highlights; 
                    <b>Bloom</b> with a tint of blue; <b>Chromatic aberration</b>; <b>Lens distortion</b>; A dark blue <b>vignette</b>. 
                    A blue <b>linear fog</b> was also applied. To add more life to the water, 
                    <b>bubble particle systems</b> were placed throughout the ocean floor, decreasing along the timeline. 
                    <b>Light beams</b> were created, using a particle system with stretched additive-blended particles.</p>

                    <p>There are quite many assets for creating realistic-looking underwater environments, but not many for free. 
                    Since we did not want this project to have any paid assets, we had to create most of the water from scratch, 
                    which was time-consuming and required a good deal of Unity experience. </p>

                    <p>There was also the issue that the water looked quite different in the Oculus Quest 2 (i.e., blurrier) 
                    than on a computer screen, so we had to go back and remove the initially applied Depth of Field effect 
                    (Gaussian blur), and also take away the Color Adjustments we used in our first drafts. 
                    A learning from this process is that finding information about how to create advanced graphics, like underwater 
                    environments, can be rather complex and cumbersome, and might require a lot of prior knowledge.</p>

                  <p>We created our own <b>Submergency soundtrack</b> and <b>sound effects</b> using Logic Pro. The soundtrack is played 
                  as background audio throughout the whole experience. We have sound effects for the <b>swimming motion</b>, i.e., 
                  a sound that is triggered when initiating a swim stroke, and a longer audio tail is audible as long as the user moves.</p>

                  <h3>Swimming experience</h3>
                  <p>In this vibrant underwater environment, we've created a lifelike swimming experience for players through numerous 
                  bold attempts. We have employed the Oculus SDK to implement the swimming interaction, aiming to allow players to 
                  interact naturally with the game while enjoying the most realistic swimming sensation possible.</p>

                  <p>During the development process, we used two different control methods: controllers and hand tracking. 
                  Although these two methods have subtle differences in implementation, they mainly utilize the Oculus SDK to 
                  obtain the hand's velocity. Based on the velocity's direction and magnitude, it's then translated into a force 
                  that propels the player forward.</p>

                  <p>Throughout this process, we encountered a series of challenges and obstacles. How do we simulate the most 
                  realistic swimming experience while allowing users to interact naturally? The Oculus SDK does provide a method to 
                  determine hand velocity, but its accuracy and latency can affect the quality of the interaction. Even minor 
                  discrepancies can be magnified, leading to player confusion or dissatisfaction. Swimming interaction is a dynamic 
                  and continuous process, introducing complications during testing as it’s not straightforward to identify issues 
                  just by setting breakpoints. In the end, we had to resort to continuously printing out key parameters to troubleshoot 
                  the problems.</p>

                  <p>It is crucial to delve into the SDK's source code during development. We cannot blindly use the methods 
                  encapsulated in the SDK without careful evaluation, as these methods might come with their own set of problems. 
                  In the process of developing a controller-less swimming interaction, our over-reliance on the Oculus SDK's hand 
                  velocity acquisition function became a glaring issue. We used this function as the foundation for our swimming 
                  interaction and based our algorithms on it. This decision subsequently led to numerous bugs and exhaustive debugging 
                  sessions. After several days of investigation, we discovered inherent issues with the method provided by Oculus, 
                  forcing us to reevaluate and discard a significant portion of our previous work. By rewriting Oculus's method, 
                  we finally solved the issue of acquiring hand velocity.</p>
